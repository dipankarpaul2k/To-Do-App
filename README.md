# To-Do App

Hi, I'm Dipankar Paul.

an enthusiastic aspiring Full Stack Developer with a passion for coding and creating.

This "To-Do App" is a project that I build using all the knowledge that I got from Apna College Delta batch, taught by Shradha Khapra ma'am.

I started from scratch to create this app, and though it was quite challenging, I persevered. While I drew design inspiration from various sources, I encountered multiple obstacles that I managed to overcome through online research. This project taught me invaluable lessons, and I am grateful for the learning experience it provided.
