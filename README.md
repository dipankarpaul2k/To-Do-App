# To-Do App


Hi, I'm Dipankar Paul.

an enthusiastic aspiring Full Stack Developer with a passion for coding and creating.

This "To-Do App" is a project that I build using all the knowledge that I got from Apna College Delta batch, taught by Shradha Khapra ma'am.

I started from scratch to create this app, and though it was quite challenging, I persevered. While I drew design inspiration from various sources, I encountered multiple obstacles that I managed to overcome through online research. This project taught me invaluable lessons, and I am grateful for the learning experience it provided.

# Technology Used

- HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for frontend development.

# Feature

- You can add task dynamically.
- Tasks can be saved by either clicking the "submit" button or pressing the "Enter" key.
- Completed tasks can be marked simply by clicking on them.
- Furthermore, clicking on a completed task will revert it back to its original position as incomplete.
- Tasks can be deleted by clicking on the 'x' icon.
- The browser's local storage retains your tasks. This means that even after reloading the page or revisiting the website, your pending tasks will remain visible until you decide to delete them.

# Usage

Modify and enhance the project as needed to demonstrate your frontend skills. You can update the design, add new features, or experiment with different technologies. Feel free to customize the project to make it your own while keeping the essence of the original website.

# Special Thanks

I extend a heartfelt appreciation to Apna College and Shradha Khapra ma'am. Your guidance has been transformative for me. The wealth of knowledge and skills I've gained is immeasurable, and I can't thank you enough.
